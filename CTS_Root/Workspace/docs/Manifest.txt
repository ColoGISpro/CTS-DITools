Please do not move or edit this file.

why you ask?  ...well,  here's the deal:
This file contains a manifest of files and directories to be removed
when CTS-DITools get updated. Basically, tweaking with this file could result
in failure to clean up any files/folders that exist in the CTS_Root during update.
Especially they are reanmed or omitted in the new version.

tl;dr
below is a list of files that will get cleaned up during update

<DirectoriesToClean>['Workspace']<_DirectoriesToClean_>
<FilesToClean>['CTS_Toolbox.tbx', 'CTS_VersionToolbox.pyt', 'CTS_VersionToolbox.pyt.xml', 'CTS_VersionToolbox.Update.pyt.xml', 'Read Me.url']<_FilesToClean_>
